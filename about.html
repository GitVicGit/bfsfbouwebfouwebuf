    <section id="about">
        <p>
            Victor Guerin is a French-born British artist (b. 1993) working across sculpture (MA, RCA, 2024), installation, and painting.
            His work explores how human interventions shape the evolution of nature, drawing from his upbringing near Poitiers and his experiences in Paris and London. 
            Guerin’s practice incorporates recycled bronze, aluminium, glass, and found objects, employing methods such as aeronautics fabrication, bioplastic cultivation, 
            and traditional lost-wax casting to explore the relationship between human technologies and natural ecosystems.

            In 2024, Guerin presented ‘Ephemeral Structures’, computer-aided coil-built ceramics blending geometric precision with organic forms, 
            and the installation ‘Echoes of Extraction’, examining material life cycles and environmental impact. His background in mechanical and industrial engineering 
            (MEng, Arts & Métiers ParisTech Grande Ecole, 2016) informs his meticulous approach to materials and form, supporting a practice often at the intersection of sculpture and applied art.

            Guerin has exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, Handbag Factory, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, among others.
            He has held residencies in China and at the Sir John Soane’s Museum in London. Awards include the Averil Picot Art Award, and he was a finalist for the Hyundai Awards 
            for Excellence in Sustainability and Creative Practice (2024). His work is held in public collections in China and private collections across the UK & c.i., Canada, and France.
