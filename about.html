                <p>A native of Poitiers, France, Victor Guerin was raised in a rural setting on the outskirts of the city where he developed a deep love of nature that continues to shape his world view. 
                </p>
                <p>His Arts et Métiers degree initially prepared him for a career as a mechanical and industrial engineer, but from the outset, Victor embarked on a decidedly unique trajectory. After internships with Christian Dior Paris, he worked for Louis Vuitton as a project manager of fine jewellery. From there, at the age of 25, he became the director of production in the decorative arts ateliers and design studio of Hervé Van der Straeten. The discipline and precision of his engineering background, combined with his experiences with artistic craftsmanship, have enabled Victor to develop an artistic sensibility grounded in scientific curiosity. This pushed Victor to simultaneously embark on his own artistic endeavours as a painter in 2020. It was not long before he was exhibiting works in galleries in Jersey, Guernsey, London and Edinburgh. He then decided to pursue his training in Sculpture at the Royal College of Art in 2023, on scholarship.
                </p> 
                <p>Victor’s approach to sculpture is deeply influenced by his background, utilising innovative materials and techniques to push the boundaries of traditional artistry. Victor's choice of materials, ranging from recycled bronze and aluminium, to botanical materials and cutting-edge 3D printed ceramics, not only exemplifies his commitment to sustainability but also reflects a fusion of past and future, embodying a timeless elegance within modernist aesthetics.
                </p>
                <p>The 'Ephemeral Structures' series, epitomises this melding of disciplines. By employing 3D printing technology, he creates pieces that juxtapose geometric accuracy with organic fluidity, challenging the conventional dichotomy between the engineered and the natural. This series, along with his broader oeuvre, invites viewers to ponder the intricate beauty of nature and the possibilities that arise when we consider ourselves not as separate from, but as integral to, the natural world. Victor's art is not merely a visual experience; it is an invitation to engage in deeper contemplation about existence, our place within the ecosystem, and the role of art in mediating this relationship.
                </p>
                <p>Looking forward, Victor aims to create large-scale outdoor installations that engage and  inspire, leveraging his innovative approach to highlight sustainability  and provoke a reevaluation of our environmental impact.
