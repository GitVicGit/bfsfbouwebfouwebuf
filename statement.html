                <p>Victor Guerin (b. 1993, France), makes sculptures and paintings that engage with nature to explore humans’ relationship with the environment. Viewed through a lens shaped by his career as an engineer and driven by a commitment to sustainability, Guerin uses materials like recycled bronze, aluminium and glass, along with botanical elements. Employing techniques ranging from lost-wax casting to digital-assisted manufacturing, Guerin’s work proposes a harmony and respect for nature through this combination of materials and processes that bridge traditional craftsmanship with contemporary innovation.
                </p>
                <p>There is a parallel between the complexity of human consciousness and natural ecosystems. Guerin creates ambiguous sculptural forms that evoke varied interpretations, all of which relate directly to nature and promote a personal connection with the environment. 
                </p> 
                <p> The work is a dialogue between art, science and philosophy, focused on the relevance of nature in our lives and our collective responsibility towards its preservation.
                </p> 
                <p>_</p>
                <p>In Guerin’s ‘Ephemeral Structures’ series, he uses computer-aided coil built ceramic to reflect on the concept of a haven that exists both within us and in the world outside, echoing childhood memories of nature's tranquillity amongst chaos. A conversation between the seen and unseen, ‘Tours et Détours’ suggests that deepest memories and unconscious experiences are intertwined with the natural world.
