                <em>Victor Guerin (b. 1993) is a Franco-British artist working across sculpture, installation, and painting. He holds an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art (2024) and an MEng from Arts et Métiers ParisTech (2016). Guerin was a finalist for the Hyundai Award for Excellence in Sustainability and Creative Practice (2024) and received the Averil Picot Art Award (2023). His work has been exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, and is held in public collections in China and private collections in the UK, Canada, and France.

                My practice investigates how human intervention shapes natural systems. At the intersection of technology and ecology, I seek not opposition but coexistence. With a background in engineering, I integrate industrial fabrication, computer-assisted processes, and traditional methods such as lost-wax casting. My material vocabulary centres on cycles of use and regeneration – combining salvaged detritus with organic elements to reflect transformation and resilience. I am particularly interested in material agency, allowing substances such as oxidised metal, eroded stone, and found fragments to generate meaning beyond direct intervention.
                <br> <br>
                In 2025, I received an institutional commission from neimënster (Luxembourg, LU) to create <em>Cracks of Potential</em> for the <em>Graines</em> exhibition – a body of work composed of salvaged concrete, bitumen, and stones that explores nature’s quiet reclamation of urban infrastructure. In 2024, I presented <em>Ephemeral Structures</em>, a series of computer-aided, coil-built ceramics balancing geometric precision with organic fluidity. My Royal College of Art degree show, <em>Echoes of Extraction</em>, examined material life cycles and their environmental consequences.
                <br> <br>
                I intend to further develop large-scale, site-responsive works and public commissions.
