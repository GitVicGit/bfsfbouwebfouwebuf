                <em>Victor Guerin (b. 1993) is a Franco-British artist working across sculpture, installation, and painting. He holds an MA in Sculpture from the Royal College of Art (2024) and an MEng from Arts et Métiers ParisTech (2016). Guerin was a finalist for the Hyundai Award for Excellence in Sustainability and Creative Practice (2024) and received the Averil Picot Art Award (2023). His work has been exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, and is held in public collections in China and private collections in the UK, Canada, and France.

                My practice examines how human interventions shape the evolution of nature. Trained in engineering, I work from first principles – gravity, load and counterbalance – so that structure is not just support but subject. Material behaviour is active: oxidised metal, eroded stone and found fragments are allowed to act rather than illustrate. The works hold resilience and fragility together, tracing cycles of use, breakage and reuse, akin to ruderal plants that colonise anthropised ground. Methods include industrial fabrication, bioplastic cultivation, computer-aided fabrication and traditional lost-wax casting, balancing the scientific with the organic.
                <br> <br>
                In 2025 I was commissioned by neimënster (Luxembourg) to create <i>Cracks of Potential</i> for the Graines exhibition: salvaged concrete, bitumen and stone assembled to show nature prising open urban fabric. In 2024 I presented <i>Ephemeral Structures</i>, a series of coil-built, computer-aided ceramics that counterpose geometric constraint with organic flow. My Royal College of Art degree show, <i>Echoes of Extraction</i>, mapped material life cycles and their environmental costs.
                <br> <br>
                I am developing large-scale, site-responsive works and public commissions.
