                _Victor Guerin is a Franco-British artist (b. 1993). Guerin graduated from the Royal College of Art, MA Sculpture (2024) and Arts et Métiers ParisTech Grande Ecole, MEng Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. Guerin was a finalist for the Hyundai Award for Excellence in Sustainability and Creative Practice (2024), and won the Averil Picot Art Award (2023). Exhibitions in Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, among others. Public collection in China and private collections across the UK, Canada, and France._

                My practice spans sculpture, installation, and painting, focusing on how human interventions shape the natural world. I explore the intersection of technology and ecology, seeking ways for them to coexist rather than conflict.
                <br>
                With a background in engineering, I work across industrial fabrication, digital-assisted manufacturing, and traditional processes such as lost-wax casting. This opens up a range of materials chosen for their histories of use and reuse. Found materials and salvaged detritus contrast with organic elements, highlighting cycles of adaptation and regeneration.
                <br> <br>
                In 2025, I was commissioned by neimënster (Luxembourg, LU) to create new work for the _Graines_ exhibition. Using bitumen removed from Luxembourg’s roads, salvaged concrete and paving stones from Neimënster Abbey – and seeds – I developed _Cracks of Potential_, a series of site-specific sculptures and installations. The project examines how nature reclaims the built environment, breaking through fissures in asphalt and concrete. It highlights urbanisation’s impact – roads and pavements covering up to 40% of city surfaces (Logan, 2021, MIT News) – while contrasting this with the resilience of plant life in overlooked spaces.
                <br>
                In 2024, I presented _Ephemeral Structures_, a series of computer-aided coil-built ceramics balancing geometric precision with organic forms as a means of introspection. For my RCA degree show, the installation _Echoes of Extraction_ explored material life cycles and environmental impact.
                <br> <br>
                I intend to further develop large-scale, site-responsive works and public commissions.
