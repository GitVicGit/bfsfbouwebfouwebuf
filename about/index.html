            <p>
                Victor Guerin is a Franco-British artist (b. 1993) who graduated with an MA Sculpture from the Royal College of Art (2024). His work explores how human interventions shape the evolution of nature, and specifically seeks to promote a harmonious relationship between human technologies and natural ecosystems, which are otherwise often seen as opposing forces. 
                <br><br>
                Guerinâ€™s previous career as an engineer provided him with a strong background in materiality. It drives his meticulous approach and commitment to sustainability in the production of pieces often situated at the intersection of sculpture and applied art. Imprinted with principles of gravity, load, and counterbalance, these works offer both resilience and fragility, reflecting the cyclical nature of use and reuse, symbolising both destruction and adaptation, akin to the ruderal plants thriving in anthropised landscapes. He selects materials such as bronze, aluminium, glass, and botanical elements; repurposes found objects; and employs industrial fabrication, bioplastic cultivation, digital-assisted manufacturing, and traditional lost-wax casting. 
                <br><br>
                In 2024, Guerin presented the installation <i>Echoes of Extraction</i>, examining material life cycles and environmental impact, and the <i>Ephemeral Structures</i> series made of computer-aided coil-built ceramics. Guerin has exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, among others. His work is held in public collections in China and private collections across the UK, Canada, and France.
