            <p>
                Victor Guerin is a Franco-British artist (b. 1993) working across sculpture (MA, Royal College of Art, 2024), installation, and painting.
                His work explores how human interventions shape the evolution of nature, drawing from his upbringing near Poitiers and his experiences in Paris and London. 
                Guerin’s practice incorporates recycled bronze, aluminium, glass, ceramics and found objects, employing methods such as aeronautics fabrication, bioplastic cultivation, 
                and traditional lost-wax casting to explore the relationship between human technologies and natural ecosystems.
            <br><br>
                In 2024, Guerin presented ‘Ephemeral Structures’, computer-aided coil-built ceramics blending geometric precision with organic forms, 
                and the installation ‘Echoes of Extraction’, examining material life cycles and environmental impact.
            <br><br>
                Guerin has exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, among others.
                His work is held in public collections in China and private collections across the UK, Canada, and France.
