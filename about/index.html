                <em>Victor Guerin is a Franco-British artist (b. 1993). Guerin graduated from the Royal College of Art, MA Sculpture (2024) and Arts et Métiers ParisTech (MEng Ingénieur Grande Ecole, 2016). Guerin was a finalist for the Hyundai Award for Excellence in Sustainability and Creative Practice (2024), and won the Averil Picot Art Award (2023). Exhibitions in Royal Scottish Academy, Dalkeith Palace, and the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts, among others. Public collection in China and private collections across the UK, Canada, and France.</em>

                My practice spans sculpture, installation, and painting, focusing on how human interventions shape the natural world. I explore the intersection of technology and ecology, seeking ways for them to coexist rather than conflict.
                <br><br>
                With a background in engineering, I work across industrial fabrication, digital-assisted manufacturing, and traditional processes such as lost-wax casting. I choose materials for their histories of use and reuse. Found and salvaged detritus contrast with organic elements, highlighting cycles of adaptation and regeneration. I am particularly interested in material agency – how metal oxidises, stone erodes, or salvaged elements retain past traces – creating meaning beyond my direct intervention. Allowing materials to assert their behaviours, I engage with their properties as active participants in shaping form, movement, and perception.
                <br> <br>
                In 2025, I received an institutional commission from neimënster (Luxembourg, LU) to create new work for the <em>Graines</em> exhibition. Using bitumen removed from Luxembourg’s roads, salvaged concrete and paving stones from Neumünster Abbey – and seeds – I developed <em>Cracks of Potential</em>, a series of site-specific sculptures and installations. The project examines how nature reclaims the built environment, breaking through fissures in asphalt and concrete. It highlights urbanisation’s impact while contrasting it with flora's resilience in overlooked spaces.
                <br> <br>
                In 2024, I presented <em>Ephemeral Structures</em>, a series of computer-aided coil-built ceramics balancing geometric precision with organic forms as a means of introspection. For my RCA degree show, the installation <em>Echoes of Extraction</em> explored material life cycles and environmental impact.
                <br> <br>
                I intend to further develop large-scale, site-responsive works and public commissions.
